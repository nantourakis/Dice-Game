GAME RULES:

- The game consist of two players, playing in turns.
- In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as they wish. Each dice roll gets added to their round score.
- But, if a player rolls a 1, then their round score gets lost and reverted back to zero. It's now the next players turn. 
- The current player can choose to "Hold", which means their round score will be kept safe and get added to their global score. It's now the next players turn.
- The first player to reach their selected winning score or 75 points by default wins.

Have Fun!
